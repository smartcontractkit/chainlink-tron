# TRON Go SDK

A Go SDK for interacting with the TRON blockchain.

## Overview

This SDK provides a native Go interface for interacting with TRON blockchain nodes through Full Node and Solidity Node HTTP APIs.

This project is a fork of [gotron-sdk](https://github.com/fbsobreira/gotron-sdk), updated to use HTTP instead of gRPC.
